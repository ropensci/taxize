#' @title Taxonomic Information from Around the Web
#'
#' @description This package interacts with a suite of web 'APIs'
#' for taxonomic tasks, such as verifying species names, getting
#' taxonomic hierarchies, and verifying name spelling.
#'
#' @section About:
#' Allows users to search over many websites for species names (scientific and
#' common) and download up- and downstream taxonomic hierarchical information -
#' and many other things.
#'
#' The functions in the package that hit a specific API have a prefix and suffix
#' separated by an underscore. They follow the format of `service_whatitdoes`.
#' For example, `gnr_resolve` uses the Global Names Resolver API to resolve
#' species names.
#'
#' General functions in the package that don't hit a specific API don't have
#' two words separated by an underscore, e.g., `classification`
#'
#' You need API keys for some data sources. See [taxize-authentication]
#' for more information.

#' @section Catalogue of Life (COL):
#' COL introduced rate limiting recently in 2019 - which has made the API

#' Lookup-table for IDs of taxonomic ranks
#'
#' data.frame of 46 rows, with 2 columns:
#' * rankid - a numeric rank id, consecutive
#' * ranks - a comma separated vector of names that are considered
#'  equal to one another within the row
#'
#' We use this data.frame to do data sorting/filtering based on the ordering
#' of ranks.
#'
#' Please let us know if there is a rank that occurs from one of the data
#' sources \pkg{taxize} that we don't have in `rank_ref` dataset.
#'
#' Let us know if you disagree with the ordering of ranks.
#' 
#' Note that `rankid` 280 are essentially "genetic variants"; placed just above
#' 'unspecified' to denote they're not without rank, but they're not
#' really taxonomic ranks either. As far as I know there's no way 
#' to delineate among these "genetic variant" types.

#' Species names from Species Plantarum
#'
#' These names have been compiled from
#' [*Species Plantarum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_Plantarum) by
#' [Carl Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus) originally
#' published in 1753. It is the first work to consistently apply
#' [binomial names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature)
#' and was the starting point for the naming of plants. The book lists every
#' species of plant known at the time, classified into
#' [genera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus). The dataset provides a
#' useful reference point to see how taxonomic names have changed since their
#' inception. The names were transcribed by Robert W. Kiger.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 5940 rows and 3 variables:
#' 
#' - genus First part of the binomial species name for each species
#' within the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus)
#' 
#' - epithet specific epithet or second part of the binomial species name
#'   for each [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species)
#' 
#' - page_number The following abbreviations sometimes are used in the
#'   page_number field.  
#'     - "add." refers to addenda that appear on the unnumbered last page of
#'       the index in volume two.
#'     - "err." refers to the unnumbered page of errata that appears following
#'       the index in volume two.
#'     - "canc." following a page number indicates that the binomial appeared
#'       on the cancelled version of that page and does not appear on its
#'       replacement (as in the 1957-1959 facsimile edition.
