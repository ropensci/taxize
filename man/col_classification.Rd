  col_classification(name = NULL, id = NULL, format = NULL,

}
\arguments{
  \item{name}{The string to search for. Only exact matches
  found the name given will be returned, unless one or
  wildcards are included in the search string.  An *
  (asterisk) character denotes a wildcard; a % (percentage)
  character may also be used. The name must be at least 3
  characters long, not counting wildcard characters.}

  \item{id}{The record ID of the specific record to return
  (only for scientific names of species or infraspecific
  taxa)}

  \item{format}{format of the results returned. Valid
  values are format=xml and format=php; if the format
  parameter is omitted, the results are returned in the
  default XML format. If format=php then results are
  returned as a PHP array in serialized string format,
  which can be converted back to an array in PHP using the
  unserialize command}

  \item{start}{The first record to return. If omitted, the
  results are returned from the first record (start=0).
  This is useful if the total number of results is larger
  than the maximum number of results returned by a single
  Web service query (currently the maximum number of
  results returned by a single query is 500 for terse
  queries and 50 for full queries).}

  \item{checklist}{The year of the checklist to query, if
  you want a specific year's checklist instead of the
  lastest as default (numeric).}

  \item{url}{The base COL url for the function (should be
  left to default).}
