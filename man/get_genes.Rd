\title{Retrieve gene sequences from NCBI by accession number.}
\usage{
  get_genes(ids, format = "fasta")
}
\arguments{
  \item{taxon_name}{Scientific name to search for
  (character).}

  \item{seqrange}{Sequence range, as e.g., "1:1000"
  (character).}

  \item{getrelated}{Logical, if TRUE, gets the longest
  sequences of a species in the same genus as the one
  searched for. If FALSE, get's nothing.}
}
\value{
  Data.frame of results.
}
\description{
  Retrieve gene sequences from NCBI by accession number.
}
\details{
  Removes predicted sequences so you don't have to remove
  them.  Predicted sequences are those with accession
  numbers that have "XM_" or "XR_" prefixes.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# A single gene
get_genes(ids="360040093", format="fasta")

# Many genes (with different accession numbers) for the same species
get_genes(ids=c("360040093","347448433"), format="fasta")
}
