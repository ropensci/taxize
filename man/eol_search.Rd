\arguments{
\item{terms}{search terms (character)}

\item{page}{A maximum of 30 results are returned per page. This parameter
allows you to fetch more pages of results if there are more than
30 matches (Default 1)}

\item{exact}{Will find taxon pages if the preferred name or any synonym
or common name exactly matches the search term.}

\item{filter_tid}{Given an EOL page ID, search results will be limited
to members of that taxonomic group}

\item{filter_heid}{Given a Hierarchy Entry ID, search results will be
limited to members of that taxonomic group}

\item{filter_by_string}{Given a search term, an exact search will be made
and that matching page will be used as the taxonomic group against which
to filter search results}

\item{cache_ttl}{The number of seconds you wish to have the response cached.}

\item{...}{Curl options passed on to \link[crul:HttpClient]{crul::HttpClient}}
}
\value{
A data frame with four columns:
\itemize{
\item pageid: pageid, this is the same as the eolid you can get from
\code{\link[=get_eolid]{get_eolid()}}
\item name: taxonomic name, may or may not contain the taxonomic authority
\item link: URL for the taxon in question
\item content: a string of semi-colon separated names. it's not clear
to us what these represent exactly, but figured why not give it to users
in case some may find it useful
