\usage{
upstream(...)

\method{upstream}{default}(x, db = NULL, upto = NULL, rows = NA, ...)

\method{upstream}{tsn}(x, db = NULL, upto = NULL, ...)

\method{upstream}{ids}(x, db = NULL, upto = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Further args passed on to \code{\link[=itis_downstream]{itis_downstream()}}}

\item{x}{Vector of taxa names (character) or IDs (character or numeric) to
query.}

\item{db}{character; database to query. One or both of \code{itis}. Note
that each taxonomic data source has their own identifiers, so that if you
provide the wrong \code{db} value for the identifier you could get a result, but
it will likely be wrong (not what you were expecting).}

\item{upto}{What taxonomic rank to go down to. One of: 'superkingdom',
'kingdom', 'subkingdom','infrakingdom','phylum','division','subphylum',
'subdivision','infradivision', 'superclass','class','subclass','infraclass',
'superorder','order','suborder','infraorder','superfamily','family',
'subfamily','tribe','subtribe','genus','subgenus', 'section','subsection',
'species','subspecies','variety','form','subvariety','race', 'stirp',
'morph','aberration','subform', or 'unspecified'}

\item{rows}{(numeric) Any number from 1 to infinity. If the default NA, all
rows are considered. Note that this parameter is ignored if you pass in a
taxonomic id of any of the acceptable classes: tsn.}
}
\value{
A named list of data.frames with the upstream names of every
supplied taxa. You get an NA if there was no match in the database.
}
\description{
This function uses a while loop to continually collect taxa up to the
taxonomic rank that you specify in the \code{upto} parameter. You can get data
from ITIS (itis) only currently. There is no method exposed by itis
for getting taxa at a specific taxonomic rank, so we do it ourselves inside
the function.
