taxize 0.4.0
===============

NEW FEATURES

* New data sources added to taxize: BOLD (Biodiversity of Life Database). Three more data sources were added (World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), Pan-European Species directories Infrastructure (PESI), and Mycobank), but are not available on CRAN. Those three data sources provide data via SOAP web services protocol, which is hard to support in R. Thus, those sources are available on Github. See https://github.com/ropensci/taxize#version-with-soap-data-sources
* New function `children()`, which is a single interface to various data sources to get immediate children from a given taxonomic name. (#304)
* New functions added to search BOLD data" `bold_search()` that searches for taxa in the BOLD database of barcode data; `get_boldid()` to search for a BOLD taxon identifier. (#301)
* New function `get_ubioid()` to get a uBio taxon identifier. (#318)
* New function started (not complete yet) to get suggested citations for the various data sources available in `taxize`: `taxize_cite()`. (#270)

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Using `jsonlite` instead of `RJSONIO` throughout the `taxize`.
* `get_ids()` gains new option to search for a uBio ID, in addition to the others, itis, ncbi, eol, col, tropicos, and gbif.
* Fixed documentation for `stripauthority` parameter `gnr_resolve()`. (#325)
* `iplant_resolve()` now outputs data.frame structure instead of a list. (#306)
* Clarified parameter `seqrange` in `ncbi_getbyname()` and `ncbi_search()` (#328)
* `synonyms()` gains new data source, can now get synonyms from uBio data source (#319)
* `vascan_search()` giving back more useful results now.

BUG FIXES

* Added error catching for when URI is too long, i.e., when too many names provided (#329) (#330)
* Various fixes to `tnrs()` function, including more meaningful error messages on failures (#323) (#331)
* Fixed bug in `getpublicationsfromtsn()` that caused function to fail on data.frame's with no data on name assignment (#297)
* Fixed bug in `sci2comm()` that caused fxn to fail when using `db=itis` sometimes (#293)
* Fixes to `scrapenames()`. Sending a text blob via the `text` parameter now works.
* Fixes to `resolve()` so that function now works for all 3 data sources. (#337)

taxize 0.3.0
===============

NEW FEATURES

* New function `iplant_resolve()` to do name resolution using the iPlant name resolution service. Note, this is different from http://taxosaurus.org/ that is wrapped in the `tnrs()` function.
* New function `ipni_search()` to search for names in the International Plant Names Index (IPNI).
* New function `resolve()` that unifies name resolution services from iPlant's name resolution service (via `iplant_resolve()`), Taxosaurus' TNRS (via `tnrs()`), and GNR's name resolution service (via `gnr_resolve()`).
* All `get_*()` functions how returning a new _uri_ attribute that is a link to the taxon on on the web. If NA is given back (e.g. nothing found), the uri attribute is blank. You can go directly to the uri in your default browser by doing, for example: `browseURL(attr(result, "uri"))`.
* `get_eolid()` now returns an attribute _provider_ because EOL collates taxonomic data form a lot of sources, then gives back IDs that are internal EOL ids, not those matching the id of the source they pull from. This should help with provenance, and should help if there is confusion about why the id givenb back by this function does not match that from the original source.
* Within the `get_tsn()` function, now using the function `itis_terms()`, which gives back the accepted status of the taxa. This allows a new parameter in the function (`accepted`, logical) that allows user to say give back only accepted status names (`accepted=TRUE`), or to give back all names (`accepted=FALSE`).
* `gnr_resolve()` gains two new parameters `best_match_only` (logical, to return best match only) and `preferred_data_sources` (to return preferred data sources) and `callopts` to pass in curl options.
* `tnrs()`, `tp_accnames()`, `tp_refs()`, `tp_summary()`, and `tp_synonyms()` gain new parameter `callopts` to pass in curl options.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `class2tree()` can now handle NA in classification objects.
* `classification.eolid()` and `classification.colid()` now return the submitted name along with the classification.
* Changed from CC0 to MIT license.
* Updated citation to have both the taxize paper in F1000 Research and the package citation.
* Sped up some functions by removing internal use of `plyr` functions, see #275.
* Removed dependency on rgbif - copied into this package a few functions needed internally. This avoids users having to install GDAL binary.
* Added in `verbose` parameter to many more functions to allow suppression of help messages.
* In most functions when using `httr`, now manually parsing JSON to a list then to another data format instead of allowing internal `httr` parsing - in addition added checks on content type and encoding in many functions.
* Added `match.arg` iternally to `get_ids()` for the `db` parameter so that a) unique short abbreviations of possible values are possible, and b) gives a meaningful warning if unsupported values are given.
* Most long-named ITIS functions (e.g., `getexpertsfromtsn`, `getgeographicdivisionsfromtsn`) gain parameter `curlopts` to pass in curl options.
* Added `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` to all `data.frame` creations to eliminate factor variables.

BUG FIXES

* `classification.gbifid()` did not return the correct result when taxon not found.
* Fixed bugs in many functions, see #245, #248, #254, #277.
* `classification()` used to fail when it was passed a subset of a vector of ids, in which case the class information was stripped off. Now works (#284)

taxize 0.2.2
===============

NEW FEATURES

* itis_downstream() and col_downstream() functions accessible now from a single function downstream() (https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/issues/238)

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Added a extension function classification() for the gbif id class, classification.gbifid() (https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/issues/241)

BUG FIXES

* Added some error catching to class2tree function. (https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/issues/240)
* Fixed problems in cbind.classification() and rbind.classification() where the first column of the ouput was a useless column name, and all column names now lower case for consistency. (https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/issues/243)
* classification() was giving back IDS instead of taxon names on the list element names, fixed this so hopefully all are giving back names. (https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/issues/243)
* Fixed bugs in col_*() functions so they give back data.frame's now with character class columns instead of factors, damned stringsAsFactors!  (https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/issues/246)


taxize 0.2.0
===============

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* New dataset: Lookup-table for family, genus, and species names for ThePlantList under dataset name "theplantlist".
* get_ids() now accepts "gbif" as an option via use of get_gbifid().
* Changed function itis_phymat_format() to phylomatic_format() - this function gets the typical Phylomatic format name string "family/genus/genus_epithet"

BUG FIXES

* Updated gbif_parse() base url to the new one (http://api.gbif.org/v1/parser/name).
* Fixes to phylomatic_tree().

NEW FEATURES

* New function class2tree() to convert list of classifications to a tree. For example, go from a list of classifications from the function classification() to this function to get a taxonomy tree in ape phylo format.
* New function get_gbfid() to get a Global Biodiversity Information Facility identifier. This is the ID GBIF uses in their backbone taxonomy.
* classification() outputs gain rbind() and cbind() generic methods that act on the various outputs of classification() to bind data width-wise, or column-wise, respectively.

taxize 0.1.9
===============

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Updated ncbi_search() to retrieve more than a max of 500, slightly changed column headers in output data files, and if didn't before, now accepts a vector/list of taxonomic names instead of just one name.

taxize 0.1.8
===============

NEW FEATURES

* We attempted to make all ouput column names lowercase, and to increase consistency across column names in outputs from similar functions.
* New function scrapenames() uses the Global Names Recognition and Discovery service to extract taxonomic names from a web page, pdf, or other document.
* New function vascan_search() to search the CANADENSYS Vascan names database.

BUG FIXES

* Fixed bugs in get_tpsid(), get_eolid() and eol_pages().
* phylomatic_tree() bugs fixed.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* classification() methods were simplified. Now classification() is the workhorse for every data-source. col_classification(), eol_hierarchy(), and tp_classification() are now deprecated and will be removed in the next taxize version.
* classification() gains four new arguments: start, checklist, key, and callopts.
* comm2sci() gains argument simplify to optionally simplify output to a vector of names (TRUE by default).
* get_eolid() and get_tpsid() both gain new arguments key to specify an API key, and ... to pass on arguments to eol_search().
* Added ncbi as a data source (db="ncbi") in sci2comm().
* tax_agg() now accepts a matrix in addition to a data.frame. Thanks to @tpoi
* tnrs() changes: Using httr instead of RCurl; now forcing splitting up name vector when long. Still issues when using POST requests (getpost="POST") wherein a request sent with 100 names only returns 30 for example. Investigating this now.

NOTES

* Function name change: tp_acceptednames() now tp_accnames().
* Function name change: tp_namedistributions() now tp_dist().
* Function name change: tp_namereferences() now tp_refs().
* Internal ldfast() function changed name to taxize_ldfast() to avoid namespace conflicts with similar function in another package.
* Three functions now with ncbi_* prefix: get_seqs() is now ncbi_getbyname(); get_genes() is now ncbi_getbyid(); and get_genes_avail() is now ncbi_search().

taxize 0.1.5
===============

NEW FEATURES

* classification() gains extension method classification.ids() to accept output from get_ids() - which attempts to get a taxonomic hierarchy from each of the taxon identifiers with the output from get_ids().
* synonyms() gains extension method synonyms.ids() to accept output from get_ids() - which attempts to get synonyms from each of the taxon identifiers with the output from get_ids().

taxize 0.1.4
===============

NEW FEATURES

* Reworked functions that interact with the ITIS API so that lower level functions were grouped together into higher level functions. All the approximately 50 lower level functions are still exported but are not included in the index help file (due to @keywords internal for each fxn) - but can still be used normally, and man files are avaialable at ?functionName.
* New function itis_ping() to check if the ITIS API service is up, similar to eol_ping() for the EOL API.
* New function itis_getrecord() to get a partial or full record, using a TSN or lsid.
* New function itis_refs() to get references associated with a TSN.
* New function itis_kingdomnames() to get all kingdom names, or kingdom name for a TSN.

* New function comm2sci() to get scientific names from input common (vernacular) names from various data sources.
* New function get_ids() to get taxonomic identifiers across all sources.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* itis_taxrank() now outputs a character, not a factor; loses parameter verbose, and gains ..., which passes on further arguments to gettaxonomicranknamefromtsn.
* tp_synonyms(), tp_summary(), plantminer(), itis_downstream(), gisd_isinvasive(), get_genes_avail(), get_genes(), eol_invasive(), eol_dataobjects(), andn tnrs() gain parameter verbose to optionally suppress messages.
* phylomatic_tree() format changed so that names are passed in normall (e.g., Poa annua) instead of the slashpath format (family/genus/genus_species). Also, taxaformat parameter dropped.
* itis_acceptname() gains ... to pass in further arguments to getacceptednamesfromtsn()
* tp_namedistributions() loses parameter format.
* get_tsn() and get_uid() return infomation about match as attribute.
* clarified iucn-documentation

BUG	FIXES

* Fixed bug in synonyms() so that further arguments can be passed on to get_tsn() to suppress messages.
* Removed test for ubio_classification_search(), a function that isn't operational yet.

taxize 0.1.1

* New function col_search() to search for names in the Catalogue of Life.
* User can turn off interactive mode in get_* functions. All get_* functions gain an ask argument, if TRUE (default) a user prompt is used for user to select which row they want, if FALSE, NA is returned when many results available; and added tests for the new argument. Affects downstream functions too.
* New function eol_invasive() to search EOL collections of invasive species lists.
* New function tp_search() to search for a taxonomic IDs from Tropicos.
* New function tp_classification() to get a taxonomic hierarchy from Tropicos.
* New function gbif_parse() to parse scientific names into their components, using the GBIF name parser API.
* New function itis_searchcommon() to search for common names across both searchbycommonnamebeginswith, and searchbycommonnameendswith.


BUG FIXES

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Added tests for new classification() methods for EOL, COL, and Tropicos.
* Added tests for new functions tp_search() and tp_classification().

NOTES

* Moved tests from inst/tests to tests/testthat according to new preferred location of tests.

taxize 0.1.0
===============

NEW FEATURES

* New function tpl_families() to get data.frame of families from The Plantlist.org site.
* New function names_list() to get a random vector of species names using the
* Added two new data sets, plantGenusNames.RData and plantNames.RData, to be used in names_list().
* New function ldfast(), a replacement function for plyr::ldply that should be faster in all cases.
* Changed API key names to be more consistent, now tropicosApiKey, eolApiKey, ubioApiKey, and pmApiKey - do change these in your .Rprofile if you store them there.
* Added a startup message.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Across most functions, removed dependencies on plyr, using ldfast() instead, for increased speed.
* Across most functions, changed from using RCurl to using httr.
* Across most functions, stop_for_status() now used directly after Curl call to check the http status code, stoping the function if appropriate code found.
* Many functions changed parameter ... to callopts, which passes on additional Curl options, with default an empty list (list()), which makes function testing easier.
* eol_search() gains parameters page, exact, filter_tid, filter_heid, filter_by_string, matching, cache_ttl, and callopts.
* eol_hierarchy() gains parameter callopts, and loses parameter usekey (always using API key now).
* eol_pages() gains parameters images, videos, sounds, maps, text, subject, licenses, details, common_names, synonyms, references, vetted, cache_ttl, and callopts.
* gni_search(): parameter url lost, is defined inside the function now, and .Rd file gains url references.
* phylomatic_tree() now checks to make sure family names were found for input taxa. If not, the function stops with message informing this.
* tpl_get() updated with fixes/improvements by John Baumgartner - now gets taxa from all groups, whereas only retrieved from Angiosperms before. In addition, csv files from The Plantlist.org are downloaded directly rather than read into R and written out again.
* tpl_search() now checks for missing data or errors, and stops function with error message.

BUG FIXES

* capwords() fxn changed to taxize_capwords() to avoid namespace conflicts with other packages with a similar function.
* ubio_namebank() was giving back base64 encoded data, now decoded appropriately.

NOTES

* Added John Baumgartner as an author.
