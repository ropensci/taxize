Package: taxize
Title: Taxonomic Information from Around the Web
Description: Interacts with a suite of web APIs for taxonomic tasks,
    such as getting database specific taxonomic identifiers, verifying
    species names, getting taxonomic hierarchies, fetching downstream and
    upstream taxonomic names, getting taxonomic synonyms, converting
    scientific to common names and vice versa, and more. Some of the APIs
    supported include NCBI eutils (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/>),
    Encyclopedia of Life (<https://eol.org/docs/what-is-eol/data-services>),
    Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/openapi/>),
    Integrated Taxonomic Information System (<https://itis.gov/web_service.html>),
    and many more. Links to the API documentation for other supported APIs are
    available in the documentation for their respective functions in this package.
