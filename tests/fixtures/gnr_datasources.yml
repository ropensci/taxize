        is a checklist of Amphibian Species in the Kihansi Gorge in the Udzungwa Tanzania.
        It is an important information on Biodiversity status of the Udzungwa Mountains
        as a Mega Biodiverse Hotspot of the Eastern Arc Mountains. It contains endemic
        and species with the risk of extinction (endangered, critically endangered,
        extinct in the wild). The studies on amphibian species commenced with the
        discovery of the Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) (Nectophrynoides asperginis) in
        December 1996 and its description in 1998 (Poynton et al., 1998). To date
        several species of amphibians in the Order Anura in Five different Families
        have been identified to exist in the Kihansi Gorge. Unfortunately Nectophrynoides
        asperginis went extinct in the wild mainly due to habitat alteration by the
        Kihansi River water abstraction where water is used for Hydro power project.
        Further studies are underway to establish the exact cause of the population
        crash of KST in the Kihansi Gorge as one of the effort to bring back the KST
        population in the  wild. These include the studies on Chytrid fungus, sediments
        flush from the reservoir,agricultural pesticide residue and water quality
        changes. Thanks to the Captive breeding programs that the species is under
        control for reintroduction back to its original habitat. This description
        therefore intends to report the amphibians occurring in the Kihansi Gorge
        i.e. amphibians occurring in the Spray Wetlands, at the edges of the spray
        wetlands as well as those appearing in other areas of the gorge. These are
        important for testing different scientific scenarios related to KSTs disappearance

        Wildlife conservation is not just a simple act of protection, it warrants
        reasonable and sustainable use of natural resources.\n\nThe Wildlife Conservation
        Act, enacted by Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, is an important legal
        basis for wildlife management and habitat protection. Its purpose is to maintain
        species diversity and ecological balance. The government and related conservation
        organizations have designated 17 wildlife refuges. Not only are they the subject
        of academic researches, they are also the indicators of environmental quality.
        The checklist of Taiwan (TaiBNET) lists 238 endangered, rare, and other protected
        species of wildlife in Taiwan. The database also provides information on these
        species, such as their scientific names (including authors and years), common

        the information can be shared and exchanged with other GBIF participants.
        Users can use keywords to link to other websites with relevant information.

        Currently, the websites have been established at Academia Sinica (http://taibnet.sinica.edu.tw
        and http://www.gbif.org.tw). Both of the Biodiversity Research Center and
        the Computing Center of Academia Sinica are in charge of the maintenance and
        the updating biodiversity related information and data.\n\nThrough the node,
        the background of participating GBIF, related documents, news, upcoming conferences,
        name list of Taiwanese taxonomists, catalog of life in Taiwan, specimen database,
        biodiversity related organization, team research projects, independent biological
        databases, natural heritage, and local publications etc. can be accessed.
        Among them, \"Name list of Taiwanese taxonomists\" and \"Catalog of Life of
        Taiwan\" are one promoting project sponsored by the National Science Council.
        So far, 236 local taxonomists have included their titles, telephones, e-mail
        addresses, and the taxa that they are expertised. In the future, we hope to
        include all of the ecologists or the applied scientists in agriculture, forestry,
        fishery, and animal husbandry in the name list.\n\nThe first phase of Catalog
        of Life in Taiwan will contain the following items of animals (including insects),
        plants, and fungi: species names, authors and year, suggested Chinese names,
        endemic in Taiwan or not, their classification hierarchy, the most authorized
        citation proving that particular species has occurred in Taiwan. Users can
        get the name list of one group of organisms through keywords search, species
        name searching, or image searching etc. Further information of each species
        can be obtained through the hyperlink to more than 18 well-known global databases
        or networks, such as Species2000 and ITIS etc. Right now, more than 30,000
        species have been compiled, and we hope to collect more than 60,000 species
        by July 2004. Species checklist of the microorganisms will be included next
        year. We hope to get more funding and collaborators in the next phase to collect
        specimen or ecological photos (endemic species first), description (morphology,
        ecology and biology), geographical distribution, synonyms, literatures, as
        well as deposited specimen data for each species.\n\nThrough this node, the
        most authorized information of high biodiversity and endemism of Taiwan can
        be exchanged and shared with other GBIF participants. This mission is also
        requested by both of the Convention on Biological Diversity and GBIF to each
        member because in such a way, education, research, and conservation of biodiversity
        in the world could be promoted effectively.","id":153,"logo_url":null,"name_strings_count":0,"refresh_period_days":14,"title":"The

        in cooperation with different Belgian and international institutions and organizations.\n\nThe
        purpose of the species list is to become the online reference in naming and
        occurrence of species in Belgium, easy to consult in just one website that
        centralizes and standardizes the information. For every species that''s been
        described, information is given on among other things the conservation status,
        the distribution, the habitat and much more. More and more species index cards
        are fitted with pictures and interesting links.\n\nThe website is aimed at
