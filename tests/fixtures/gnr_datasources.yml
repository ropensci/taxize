        Catalogue of Life is an assembly of expert-based global species checklists
        with the aim to build a comprehensive catalogue of all known species of organisms
        on Earth. Continuous progress is made towards completion, but for now, it
        probably includes just over 80% of the world''s known species. The Catalogue
        of Life estimates 2.3M extant species on the planet recognised by taxonomists
        at present time. This means that for many groups it continues to be deficient,
        and users may notice that many species are still missing from the Catalogue.\n\n###

        different resources, no matter if these are occurrence datasets, species pages,
        names from nomenclators or external sources like EOL, Genbank or IUCN. This
        backbone allows taxonomic search, browse and reporting operations across all
        those resources in a consistent way and to provide means to crosswalk names
        from one source to another.\", \"It is updated regulary through an automated
        process in which the Catalogue of Life acts as a starting point also providing
        the complete higher classification above families. Additional scientific names
        only found in other authoritative nomenclatural and taxonomic datasets are
        then merged into the tree, thus extending the original catalogue and broadening
        the backbones name coverage.          The GBIF Backbone taxonomy also includes

        resources iBOL and UNITE.\", \"International Barcode of Life project (iBOL),

        classification by taking into account all names applied to the BIN and picking
        names with at least 80% consensus. If there is no consensus of name at the
        species level, the selection process is repeated moving up the major Linnaean
        ranks until consensus is achieved.\", \"UNITE - Unified system for the DNA
        based fungal species, Species Hypotheses (SHs).  SHs are connected to a taxon
        name and its classification based on the determination of the RefS (reference

        is a checklist of Amphibian Species in the Kihansi Gorge in the Udzungwa Tanzania.
        It is an important information on Biodiversity status of the Udzungwa Mountains
        as a Mega Biodiverse Hotspot of the Eastern Arc Mountains. It contains endemic
        and species with the risk of extinction (endangered, critically endangered,
        extinct in the wild). The studies on amphibian species commenced with the
        discovery of the Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) (Nectophrynoides asperginis) in
        December 1996 and its description in 1998 (Poynton et al., 1998). To date
        several species of amphibians in the Order Anura in Five different Families
        have been identified to exist in the Kihansi Gorge. Unfortunately Nectophrynoides
        asperginis went extinct in the wild mainly due to habitat alteration by the
        Kihansi River water abstraction where water is used for Hydro power project.
        Further studies are underway to establish the exact cause of the population
        crash of KST in the Kihansi Gorge as one of the effort to bring back the KST
        population in the  wild. These include the studies on Chytrid fungus, sediments
        flush from the reservoir,agricultural pesticide residue and water quality
        changes. Thanks to the Captive breeding programs that the species is under
        control for reintroduction back to its original habitat. This description
        therefore intends to report the amphibians occurring in the Kihansi Gorge
        i.e. amphibians occurring in the Spray Wetlands, at the edges of the spray
        wetlands as well as those appearing in other areas of the gorge. These are
        important for testing different scientific scenarios related to KSTs disappearance
        in the Kihansi Gorge since 2003.","id":99,"logo_url":null,"name_strings_count":0,"refresh_period_days":14,"title":"Kihansi

        Wildlife conservation is not just a simple act of protection, it warrants

        islands such as Penghu Archipelago, Orchid Island, Green Island, etc. Even

        50,000 valid species scientific names. Among them, 8,000 are endemic species
        (including endemic subspecies and varietas), showing the abundance of Taiwan\u2019s

        synonyms. Through Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF), the information
        on these endemic species are published and then shared and exchanged with

        the Computing Center of Academia Sinica are in charge of the maintenance and
        the updating biodiversity related information and data.\n\nThrough the node,
        the background of participating GBIF, related documents, news, upcoming conferences,
        name list of Taiwanese taxonomists, catalog of life in Taiwan, specimen database,
        biodiversity related organization, team research projects, independent biological
        databases, natural heritage, and local publications etc. can be accessed.
        Among them, \"Name list of Taiwanese taxonomists\" and \"Catalog of Life of
        Taiwan\" are one promoting project sponsored by the National Science Council.
        So far, 236 local taxonomists have included their titles, telephones, e-mail
        addresses, and the taxa that they are expertised. In the future, we hope to
        include all of the ecologists or the applied scientists in agriculture, forestry,
        fishery, and animal husbandry in the name list.\n\nThe first phase of Catalog
        of Life in Taiwan will contain the following items of animals (including insects),
        plants, and fungi: species names, authors and year, suggested Chinese names,
        endemic in Taiwan or not, their classification hierarchy, the most authorized
        citation proving that particular species has occurred in Taiwan. Users can
        get the name list of one group of organisms through keywords search, species
        name searching, or image searching etc. Further information of each species
        can be obtained through the hyperlink to more than 18 well-known global databases
        or networks, such as Species2000 and ITIS etc. Right now, more than 30,000
        species have been compiled, and we hope to collect more than 60,000 species
        by July 2004. Species checklist of the microorganisms will be included next
        year. We hope to get more funding and collaborators in the next phase to collect
        specimen or ecological photos (endemic species first), description (morphology,
        ecology and biology), geographical distribution, synonyms, literatures, as
        well as deposited specimen data for each species.\n\nThrough this node, the
        most authorized information of high biodiversity and endemism of Taiwan can
        be exchanged and shared with other GBIF participants. This mission is also
        requested by both of the Convention on Biological Diversity and GBIF to each

        Biodiversity Platform (http://www.biodiversity.be) in the framework of the
        \"GBIF award for evaluating checklist publication format\" during May 2011.\n\nData
        extracted by Francis Strobbe on May 27th 2011.\n\nAbstract of the Belgian
        Species List project:\nSince almost a year now, people of all ages can access
        the Belgian Species List for an extensive overview of the biodiversity in
        Belgium. Animals, plants, fungi: you can make your way through a total of
        more than 32.000 species!\n\nThe Belgian species list was set up by the RBINS
        \u2013 the research institution behind the Museum of Natural Sciences \u2013
        in cooperation with different Belgian and international institutions and organizations.\n\nThe
        purpose of the species list is to become the online reference in naming and
        occurrence of species in Belgium, easy to consult in just one website that
        centralizes and standardizes the information. For every species that''s been
        described, information is given on among other things the conservation status,
        the distribution, the habitat and much more. More and more species index cards
        are fitted with pictures and interesting links.\n\nThe website is aimed at
        a broad audience: researchers, decision makers, students, journalists, nature

        The introduction in 1994 of a scientifically rigorous approach to determine

        standard. In order to produce the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122,
        the IUCN Species Programme working with the IUCN Survival Commission (SSC)
        and with members of IUCN draws on and mobilizes a network of scientists and
