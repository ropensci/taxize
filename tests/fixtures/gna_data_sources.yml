It is an important information on Biodiversity status of the Udzungwa Mountains as a Mega Biodiverse Hotspot of the Eastern Arc Mountains. It contains endemic and species with the risk of extinction (endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild). The studies on amphibian species commenced with the discovery of the Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) (Nectophrynoides asperginis) in December 1996 and its description in 1998 (Poynton et al., 1998). To date several species of amphibians in the Order Anura in Five different Families have been identified to exist in the Kihansi Gorge. Unfortunately Nectophrynoides asperginis went extinct in the wild mainly due to habitat alteration by the Kihansi River water abstraction where water is used for Hydro power project. Further studies are underway to establish the exact cause of the population crash of KST in the Kihansi Gorge as one of the effort to bring back the KST population in the  wild. These include the studies on Chytrid fungus, sediments flush from the reservoir,agricultural pesticide residue and water quality changes. Thanks to the Captive breeding programs that the species is under control for reintroduction back to its original habitat. This description therefore intends to report the amphibians occurring in the Kihansi Gorge i.e. amphibians occurring in the Spray Wetlands, at the edges of the spray wetlands as well as those appearing in other areas of the gorge. These are important for testing different scientific scenarios related to KSTs disappearance in the Kihansi Gorge since 2003.","curation":"NotCurated","hasTaxonData":false,"recordCount":12,"updatedAt":"2012-02-09"},{"id":100,"title":"Mushroom Observer","titleShort":"Mushroom Observer","description":"Purpose: record observations about mushrooms, help people identify mushrooms they aren’t familiar with, and expand the community around the scientific exploration of mushrooms (mycology)","curation":"NotCurated","hasTaxonData":false,"recordCount":177,"updatedAt":"2012-02-09"},{"id":101,"title":"TaxonConcept","titleShort":"TaxonConcept","description":"TaxonConcept provides human and machine readable species description documents that help describe the attributes and variation within a species.

For every core taxon in the checklist (species, subspecies, or variety), VASCAN provides the accepted scientific name, the accepted French and English vernacular names, and their synonyms/alternatives in Canada, as well as the distribution status (native, introduced, ephemeral, excluded, extirpated, doubtful or absent) of the plant for each province or territory, and the habit (tree, shrub, herb and/or vine) of the plant in Canada. For reported hybrids (nothotaxa or hybrid formulas) VASCAN also provides the hybrid parents, except if the parents of the hybrid do not occur in Canada. All taxa are linked to a classification. VASCAN refers to a source for all name, classification and distribution information.\n\nAll data have been released to the public domain under a CC0 waiver and are available through Canadensys and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).

Currently, the websites have been established at Academia Sinica (http://taibnet.sinica.edu.tw and http://www.gbif.org.tw). Both of the Biodiversity Research Center and the Computing Center of Academia Sinica are in charge of the maintenance and the updating biodiversity related information and data.\n\nThrough the node, the background of participating GBIF, related documents, news, upcoming conferences, name list of Taiwanese taxonomists, catalog of life in Taiwan, specimen database, biodiversity related organization, team research projects, independent biological databases, natural heritage, and local publications etc. can be accessed. Among them, \"Name list of Taiwanese taxonomists\" and \"Catalog of Life of Taiwan\" are one promoting project sponsored by the National Science Council. So far, 236 local taxonomists have included their titles, telephones, e-mail addresses, and the taxa that they are expertised. In the future, we hope to include all of the ecologists or the applied scientists in agriculture, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry in the name list.\n\nThe first phase of Catalog of Life in Taiwan will contain the following items of animals (including insects), plants, and fungi: species names, authors and year, suggested Chinese names, endemic in Taiwan or not, their classification hierarchy, the most authorized citation proving that particular species has occurred in Taiwan. Users can get the name list of one group of organisms through keywords search, species name searching, or image searching etc. Further information of each species can be obtained through the hyperlink to more than 18 well-known global databases or networks, such as Species2000 and ITIS etc. Right now, more than 30,000 species have been compiled, and we hope to collect more than 60,000 species by July 2004. Species checklist of the microorganisms will be included next year. We hope to get more funding and collaborators in the next phase to collect specimen or ecological photos (endemic species first), description (morphology, ecology and biology), geographical distribution, synonyms, literatures, as well as deposited specimen data for each species.\n\nThrough this node, the most authorized information of high biodiversity and endemism of Taiwan can be exchanged and shared with other GBIF participants. This mission is also requested by both of the Convention on Biological Diversity and GBIF to each member because in such a way, education, research, and conservation of biodiversity in the world could be promoted effectively.","curation":"NotCurated","hasTaxonData":false,"recordCount":52611,"updatedAt":"2012-02-09"},{"id":154,"title":"Psocodea Species File","titleShort":"Psocodea Species File","description":"This file contains taxon names and related nomenclatural information for the order Psocodea originating from the Psocodea Species File maintained by the Species File Group (http://software.speciesfile.org) at the University of Illinois, Illinois Natural History Survey.","curation":"NotCurated","hasTaxonData":true,"recordCount":7517,"updatedAt":"2012-02-09"},{"id":155,"uuid":"bacd21f0-44e0-43e2-914c-70929916f257","title":"FishBase","titleShort":"FishBase","description":"FishBase, a  global information system with all you ever wanted to know about fishes.

It allows collaborative editing and linking of the classification, literature, and morphological traits of the many-legged terrestrial invertebrate groups Onychophora and Myriapoda (to the inclusion of Euthycarcinoidea). The taxonomic backbone is based on the Species 2000 \u0026 ITIS Catalogue of Life (2015 release). The literature database contains circa 1300 references, spanning from 1535 to present. This dataset represents the output of an ongoing endeavor, and therefore is periodically updated.
