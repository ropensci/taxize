## Reverse dependencies

* I have run R CMD check on the 22 downstream dependencies
(<https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/blob/master/revdep/README.md>);
there was an error in one package (spocc, also maintained by me) but only in the development version on GitHub, which I've fixed and a new version will be submitted soon.

------

This version includes a new function for parsing scientific names, drops 3 package imports, and makes many bug fixes.

Thanks!
